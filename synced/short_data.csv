""The rooftops of the world are caving in,"" Guterres said on a visit to the Everest region in mountainous Nepal, adding that the country had lost nearly a third of its ice in just over three decades. ""Glaciers are icy reservoirs -- the ones here in the Himalayas supply fresh water to well over a billion people,"" he said. ""When they shrink, so do river flows."" Nepal's glaciers melted 65 percent faster in the last decade than in the previous one, said Guterres, who is on a four-day visit to Nepal. Glaciers in the wider Himalayan and Hindu Kush ranges are a crucial water source for around 240 million people in the mountainous regions, as well as for another 1.65 billion people in the South Asian and Southeast Asian river valleys below. The glaciers feed 10 of the world's most important river systems, including the Ganges, Indus, Yellow, Mekong and Irrawaddy, and directly or indirectly supply billions of people with food, energy, clean air and income. Scientists say they are melting faster than ever before due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters. ""I am here today to cry out from the rooftop of the world: stop the madness"", Guterres said, speaking from Syangboche village, with the icy peak of the world's highest mountain Everest towering behind him. ""The glaciers are retreating, but we cannot. We must end the fossil fuel age,"" he said. The world has warmed an average of nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since the mid-1800s, unleashing a cascade of extreme weather, including more intense heatwaves, more severe droughts and storms made more ferocious by rising seas. Hardest hit are the most vulnerable people and the world's poorest countries, which have done little to contribute to the fossil fuel emissions that drive up temperatures. ""We must act now to protect people on the frontline, and to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees, to avert the worst of climate chaos,"" Guterres said. ""The world can't wait."" In the first phase of climate change's effects, melting glaciers can trigger destructive floods. ""Melting glaciers mean swollen lakes and rivers flooding, sweeping away entire communities"", he added. But all too soon, glaciers will dry up if change is not made, he warned. ""In the future, major Himalayan rivers like the Indus, the Ganges and Brahmaputra could have massively reduced flows, he said. ""That spells catastrophe""."

The flash floods seem to have been triggered by a combination of factors. A cloud burst ripped apart the South Shonak Lake — a glacial body in the state’s northwest. According to Sikkim’s Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), the Teesta has inundated at least four districts in the state. The calamity was aggravated by the release of water from the Chungthang dam — initial reports suggest that the breach was caused by water rushing from the mountains. Disaster management authorities are also investigating the possibility of the event being triggered by an earthquake in Nepal on Tuesday. The probe is likely to throw more light on the immediate causes of the flash flood but one thing has long been clear — states in the Himalayan region must respect the fragile ecology of the mountains and put in adequate safeguards to mitigate the damage caused by increasingly frequent extreme rainfall events. For years, studies have red-flagged the South Shonak Lake’s expansion due to glacial melting and warned that the water body is susceptible to breaches. In 2021, for instance, a study by scientists from IIT Roorkee, Indian Institute of ScienceBangalore, University of Dayton, USA, University of Graz, Austria, and the Universities of Zurich and Geneva in Switzerland recommended regular monitoring of the lake’s growth and continuous assessment of the region’s slope stability. The National Disaster Management Authority guidelines also say that risk reduction has to begin with mapping such water bodies, taking structural measures to prevent their breach and establishing mechanisms that can alert people about glacial lake outbursts. The IMD has collaborated with the US National Weather Service to warn people about six to 24 hours before a flash flood. But the system doesn’t seem to have come to terms with the Himalayan region’s idiosyncrasies. The Northeast has a key place in the hydel power push of successive governments at the Centre. The Chungthang Dam is a part of the 1,200 MW Teesta Stage 3 Hydroelectric Project. The government claims that such projects are climate-friendly because of their low emissions intensity. Hydroelectric power is also a major source of revenue for Sikkim. Ecologists, however, caution against the adverse effects of dam construction — it increases the volatility of rocks in the Himalayan region. Wednesday’s disaster is a warning to take such caveats seriously and install robust safety mechanisms."

New Delhi, India– Israel’srelentless bombingof the besieged Gaza Strip and killing of nearly 6,000 people – a third of them children – in two weeks has outraged people across the world, triggering mass protests and a call for an immediate ceasefire. However, in India – the first non-Arab country to recognise the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), but now seen closer to Israel and its biggest benefactor, the United States – some pro-Palestine protesters reported being targeted by the government. Less than a week after the Gaza assault began, police in Hamirpur district of India’s most populous Uttar Pradesh state were looking for Muslim scholars Atif Chaudhary and Suhail Ansari. Their alleged crime: putting a WhatsApp display photo that said: “I stand with Palestine.” The two men were charged with promoting enmity between social groups. Ansari is under arrest, while Chaudhary is on the run, according to the police. In the same state, governed by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), four students of the Aligarh Muslim University were booked by the police after they took out a pro-Palestine march on the campus a day after the Gaza assault began on October 7. However, when the Hindu far-right group Bajrang Dal took out a pro-Israel march in the same Aligarh city, raising slogans such as “Down with Palestine, Down with Hamas”, no action was taken against them by the authorities. In the national capital, New Delhi, there have been several examples of people being detained during rallies organised by student groups, activists and citizens for solidarity with the Palestinians since October 7.      In the western state of Maharashtra, also governed by the BJP in alliance with a regional party, two protesters, Ruchir Lad and Supreeth Ravish, were arrested on October 13 for holding a march against the war on Gaza and charged with unlawful assembly. Pooja Chinchole, member of the Revolutionary Workers Party of India and one of the organisers of the protest held in state capital Mumbai, told Al Jazeera the police “created many hurdles before us when they got to know that we are organising a pro-Palestine protest”. “They detained one of the organisers a day before the protest and three organisers on the morning of the protest. When we still gathered to protest, they snatched our microphone, placards, and after a while, started using force on some of us,” she said. The crackdown, however, was not limited to the BJP-ruled states only. In the southern Karnataka state, governed by the main opposition Congress party, police charged 10 activists with creating a public nuisance after they organised a silent march in support of the Palestinians on October 16 in Bengaluru, the capital of the state. The Karnataka police also arrested a 58-year-old Muslim man for allegedly posting a video in support of Hamas on WhatsApp. Police also briefly detained Alam Nawaz, a Muslim government employee, for updating his WhatsApp status with a Palestinian flag and “Long Live Palestine” message. “People started seeing me with suspicion as if I have committed some crime by expressing my solidarity with Palestinian people,” Nawaz, 20, told Al Jazeera. All this despite the Congress expressing its support for the “rights of the Palestinian people to land, self-government and to live with dignity” as the party called for an immediate ceasefire in a resolution passed by its working committee on October 9. Meanwhile, pro-Israel rallies, organised mainly byHindu right-wing groups, were seen across India, while many on social media offered their services to the Israeli forces. On Saturday, dozens of supporters of a retired Indian army soldier travelled 182km (113 miles) to reach the Israeli embassy in New Delhi where they offered to go to Israel to fight against the Palestinians in Gaza. Last week, one of India’s most influential Hindu nationalists, Yati Narsinghanand, released a video in which he said Hindus and Jews “have the same enemy: Muhammad and his satanic book” as he urged the Israeli government to allow 1,000 Hindus to settle in Israel in order to “take on those Muslims”.      Israel’s ambassador to India, Naor Gilon, on October 8 said he had received several requests from Indians wanting to voluntarily fight for Israel. Apoorvanand, professor of Hindi language at Delhi University, told Al Jazeera he was not surprised that the Hindu far right, which openly admires Adolf Hitler for his action against the Jews, is now supporting the Zionists in Israel. “Hindu far-right organisations in India have always supported those who dominate by violence. Hitler did once, so they supported him. Now Israel is doing this, so they are supporting it,” he said. Apoorvanand said the Hindu right in India thinks there are ideological linkages between them and the Zionists in Israel. “It looks like Israel is fighting a proxy war on behalf of the Hindu far right. They think Israel is fighting and decimating Muslims on their behalf. The way they want to establish Akhand Bharat [Unified India] by joining Pakistan, Afghanistan, Nepal together with India, they think Israel is following the same expansionist ideology,” he said. This was not always the case. India’s foreign policy has historically supported the Palestinian cause, which began with India voting against the United Nations resolution to create the state of Israel in 1947 and then recognising the PLO as a representative of the Palestinian people in 1974. India’s pro-Palestine stand was guided by the shared history of colonisation by the British, Zikrur Rahman, former Indian ambassador to Palestine, told Al Jazeera. “In the postcolonial era, we identified that this is a colonial attempt to divide the country and to create another country. We were not in favour of the creation of a country on the basis of religion,” he said.      Rahman, however, added that while India’s position on Palestine has not changed, it is not as strong as it used to be. India recognised the creation of Israel in 1950, but did not establish diplomatic relations until 1992, when the details of the firstOslo Accordwere being finalised. Since then, India has tried to strike a balance between its strategic relations with Israel and sympathising with the Palestinian struggle. Today, India is the largest buyer of Israeli-made weapons, while strategic and security cooperation between them has grown manifold. Comparisons have also been made between Israel demolishing homes of Palestinians in the occupied territories and a similar policy adopted by some BJP state governmentsmainly against Muslimsas forms of “collective punishment” of the community. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi came to power in 2014, he has made public statements, calling his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu a “good friend” on several occasions. Modi was one of the first global leaders to post his solidarity with Israel after Hamas’s unprecedented incursion on October 7. “Deeply shocked by the news of terrorist attacks in Israel,” said his post on X, which came four hours before US President Joe Biden reacted to the event. Modi also condemned the Israeli attack onal-Ahli Arab Hospitalin Gaza on October 18, in which nearly 500 Palestinians were killed, though his message on X appeared nearly eight hours after Biden’s post. Meanwhile, India’s Ministry of External Affairs issued a statement on October 12, reiterating New Delhi’s position of establishing a “sovereign, independent, and viable state of Palestine, living within secure and recognised borders, side by side at peace with Israel”. Last week, Modi posted on X about his phone call with the Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, in which he repeated India’s “longstanding principled position on the Israel-Palestine issue”. He said his government is sending humanitarian assistance for the besieged residents of Gaza. Journalist Anand K Sahay, however, thinks India’s response to the unfolding humanitarian disaster in Gaza has not been adequate. “What India didn’t say is important. India didn’t demand a ceasefire. Historically, India has always demanded a ceasefire in case of a [foreign] war. In this case also we should have strongly said: stop the war,” he told Al Jazeera. Sahay said Modi’s flaunting of closeness with Israel is also aimed at appeasing his core vote bank: the Hindus. “Suppose there was another religion in majority in Palestine. Then our stand may have been different. During the Russia-Ukraine war, we said ‘this is not an age of war’. Why couldn’t we say this in case of Israel-Palestine war?” asked Sahay. “By not asking for a ceasefire, India was also indirectly signalling the US that the Indian position was very close to the US line.”               Follow Al Jazeera English:"

Its largest airlines have ordered nearly 1,000 jets this year, committing tens of billions of dollars to a spending spree that is unparalleled in aviation. In NewDelhi, Indira Gandhi International Airport will be ready for 109 million passengers next year, as it prepares to become the world’s second busiest, behind Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the United States. And this is happening in a vast country still heavily reliant on trains — with 20 journeys by rail for every one by air. The enormous aviation build-out, with a surge of investment behind it, has pride of place in India’s case for a greater standing on the world stage. As it moves up the ranks of the world’s biggest economies, India is scrambling to meet the expanding ambitions of its ascendant middle class. Its airports present highly visible achievements. Air travel remains out of the financial reach of most Indians. An estimated 3% of the country’s population flies on a regular basis. But in a nation of 1.4 billion people, that percentage represents 42 million — executives, students and engineers who yearn to get quickly from here to there inside India’s borders, and to gain easier access to destinations beyond, for both business and vacation. Kapil Kaul, CEO of CAPA India, an advisory firm focused on aviation, calls “the next two to three years critical for achieving the quality of growth that India desires and deserves.” Growth has so far been profitless. Now Indian aviation must prove it can make money. The effects of the spending spree should redound across India’s economy. Cargo comes with passenger traffic, and foreign investment tends to follow closely behind, Kaul said. Arrivals to the international terminal at Indira Gandhi Airport are greeted by a wall of giant sculptural hands, their fingers and palms folded into the signifying shapes of the Buddha’s gestures, looking both ancient and futuristic. In 2012, when they were installed, 30 million passengers passed through the airport. By the time the airport has expanded to its new capacity, another one will have been built from scratch on the other side of the city. Indira Gandhi Airport is racing to get bigger. In July it added a fourth runway and opened an elevated taxiway. The company that operates it, GMR Airports, took over in 2006, a time when all arrivals walked past cows lazing in the dust to reach a taxi stand. By 2018 the facility was rated as India’s most valuable infrastructural asset. To spare the use of jet fuel, a battery-powered TaxiBot lugs idling planes around the tarmac. An automated luggage-handling system can sort 6,000 bags an hour. Two beneficiaries of India’s expanding aviation market are the world’s largest airplane makers: Boeing in America and Airbus in Europe. In February, Air India, which Tata Group took private last year, agreed to buy 250 planes from Airbus and 220 from Boeing, worth a combined $70 billion. In June, IndiGo, the country’s biggest carrier by passengers and flights, ordered 500 new Airbus A230s. The bulk of the growth of Indian aviation has been among homegrown airlines, which have clocked a 36% increase in passengers since 2022. Foreign tourist arrivals are rebounding since the pandemic, but are still relatively scarce, barely topping 10 million in a good year (about the same as Romania). So low-cost carriers are adding new countries to their destinations in order to accommodate India’s demand for foreign tourism. Azerbaijan, Kenya and Vietnam are all a direct flight from Delhi orMumbai, India’s financial capital, for less than 21,000 rupees ($250) one way. The air corridor between Delhi and Mumbai was already one of the world’s 10 busiest. Like Delhi, Mumbai has new airport terminals that would be the envy of any city in America, not to mention the glorious new all-bamboo Terminal 2 at Kempegowda International Airport in Bengaluru, a city in southern India. But the expansion in infrastructure is not limited to the country’s premier metropolitan areas. Prime MinisterNarendra Modi’s government likes to point out that the number of airports has doubled in the nine years since he took office, to 148 from 74. Jyotiraditya Scindia, Modi’s aviation minister, said there would be at least 230 by 2030. The government has invested more than $11 billion in airports over the past decade, and Scindia has promised another $15 billion. That means that sleepy towns such asDarbhanga, a former principality in the impoverished state of Bihar in eastern India, now have nonstop access to Delhi, Bengaluru and beyond. For many of the 900 travelers a day who fill its flights, including plenty from nearby Nepal, the new airport has transformed the journey. Prasanna Kumar Jha, 52, was born in Darbhanga but works in Delhi as a tax consultant. “Who ever expected that Darbhanga would be on the air map?” he asked. Flying to his hometown on short notice to see his ailing mother cost him 10,500 rupees ($126), which pinched. “But if you calculate the alternative — by train from Delhi and then taxi to Darbhanga — it will take at least 30 hours,” he said. “The plane journey is no longer a luxury but a necessity.” Darbhanga’s airport is a far cry from New Delhi’s. There is no parking lot. Passengers walk from the edge of a highway past a checkpoint to wait on benches outside the terminal. Then they wait on another set of outdoor benches after clearing the security check. But it works. Another passenger on the same flight at Darbhanga, Ajay Jha, was cradling his 1-year-old daughter, Saranya, as he stood near the rudimentary baggage claim. His family was on the last leg of a trip that started in Bellevue, Washington, where he works as an engineer for Amazon, to a family reunion in the Bihari countryside. Traveling halfway around the world took less time than Jha used to spend getting home from his school in Bengaluru. Yet a vast majority of Indians cannot afford such conveniences. The annual mean income is still less than a single economy-class fare from the United States, and, in this top-heavy economy, most Indians earn much less than that. Middle class, in Indian parlance, indicates somewhere close to the top of the pyramid. A report by CAPA India counted just 0.13 passenger seats per capita in 2019 for Indians, compared with 0.52 for Chinese and 3.03 for Americans. But aviation companies and India’s elected officials look at the low penetration and see opportunity. A scarcity of competition, in the face of an emerging duopoly between IndiGo and the Tata-led airlines, is one of the new landscape’s most striking features. Smaller competitors keep going bust, most recently Go First, which declared bankruptcy in May. A shortage of pilots, after dozens were poached by bigger companies, forced Akasa Air, a promising upstart, to cancel flights in August. But supply shortages are not the worst kind of problem to have in today’s global economy. With aviation’s growth in the decade before the pandemic steady at about 15% a year, the Indian boom seems all but guaranteed to change the future of aviation worldwide. If the benefits accruing to the winners in India’s economy can be coaxed into trickling outward and downward, the same could go for many other sectors."

Worlds most loved landmarks; Taj Mahal secures 2nd spot,Nepal,"NEW DELHI: India preferred Bangladesh over Nepal for the post of regional director of World Health Organisation’s (WHO) Southeast Asia Region contributing to the comfortable victory of Saima Wazed, daughter of Bangla PM Sheikh Hasina .Although officials were tight-lipped about which way India voted, sources said that it voted for Wazed at the expense of Dr Shambhu Acharya, who could manage one vote, apart from Nepal’s.It could not have been an easy decision as India has been working to improve ties with both neighbours. The decision may have been influenced by Bangladesh PM Sheikh Hasina’s effort to stop Islamic terrorist groups, many of them backed by Pakistan, from using Bangladesh as a base to launch attacks against India. The personal stake of Sheikh Hasina, who faces an increasingly tough situation on the domestic front ahead of elections next year, in the outcome of a contest featuring her daughter and China’s effort to woo her, also perhaps helped tip scales in Wazed’s favour.Wazed, who is a global autism advocate and has been a member of the WHO’s 25-member expert advisory panel on mental health, would have won in any case as eight of the 10 member nations preferred her over Dr Acharya who is a WHO specialist.WHO said that Wazed’s nomination will be submitted to the WHO executive board during its 154th session, taking place on 22-27 January 2024 in Geneva, Switzerland, and that the newly appointed regional director will take office on 1 February 2024.The Bangladesh High Commission, in its statement announcing the victory, said their ministry of foreign affairs, in coordination with the ministry of health and family welfare, conducted an effective campaign in Wazed’s favour since the very beginning of the election process."

Scientists are increasingly watching how climate change is impacting the environmentally fragile Himalayas, home to the planet's tallest peaks and the source of water for rivers that hundreds of millions of people depend on. Since the end of September, a Chinese team has set up five automatic weather stations on Cho Oyu, at altitudes from 4,950m to its summit at 8,201m, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Friday (Oct 6). Snow and ice samples at the summit had been collected for the first time, Xinhua reported. Initial research showed that the ice layer on Cho Oyu was the thickest among peaks above 8,000m, with a thickness of more than 70m being seen, Xinhua reported. The weather stations on Cho Oyu, which means ""Turquoise Goddess"" in Tibetan, expand a Chinese meteorological network in the Himalayas that includes monitoring of the 8,848m Everest, also on the border with Nepal, and the 8,013m Shishapangma in Tibet. Monitoring the effects of global warming has taken on urgency after one of the warmest summers in the northern hemisphere this year.Mont Blanc, Western Europe's highest peak, has lost more than 2m in height over two yearsbecause of its shrinking snowpack, researchers said on Thursday. Torrential rain in India's northeastern Sikkim state burst the banks of a glacial lake and triggered flash floodsthis week, killing at least 40 people in the latest example of extreme weather events in the mountain range that scientists have blamed on climate change. High-altitude surveillance was imperative to avoid disasters such as floods and ice avalanches as glaciers melt, Xinhua reported, citing Yang Wei, a researcher at the Institute of Tibetan Plateau Research of Chinese Academy of Sciences."

Even as glaciers melt, the village of Samdzong is running dry. And as global warming ravages the Himalayas, communities there have no choice but to adapt and uproot themselves. Recounting his experience, Mr Board said filming the story was an ""absolute privilege and challenge"". ""Upper Mustang is a naturally breathtaking environment, and while it felt so distant, the local challenges there are so connected to the overall climate change threat that the world is facing,"" he said. ""Reaching the high-altitude glacial lake, featured in the story, was the most physically demanding thing I’ve ever done in my life. Yet it’s in these hard-to-reach places that climate change is hitting in most dramatic fashion. What happens up there really matters.”"

While about 407,000 Indian nationals emigrated in 2021, the country also leads in acquiring citizenship in the OECD area, with the US, followed by Australia and Canada, dominating. According to theresearch, titled“International Migration Outlook: 2023,”released on Monday in France, the US handed out the most passports to Indian immigrants (56,000), followed by Australia (24,000) and Canada (21,000). A total of 133,000 Indians were granted citizenship in an OCED country in 2021. The OECD, which has 38 member countries, was founded in 1961 to stimulate economic progress and world trade. Most of these countries are considered""rich""and""developed""and attract migrant workers and students. Canada, according to the study, recorded the most significant proportional increase in granting citizenship to foreign nationals, with a 174% increase between 2021 and 2022. The North American country, which recently accused New Delhi of conducting a political assassination in a Vancouver suburb, added a record 375,000 new citizens in 2022. The highest number of immigrants issued Canadian passports in 2022 came from India (60,000), followed by the Philippines (42,000), Syria (20,000) and Pakistan (15,000). A shift overseas generally results in higher incomes for Indians. The World Development Report, released in April, showed an estimated 120% gain for Indians who moved abroad for work. According to the report, low-skilled Indians immigrating to the US stand to gain the most, as they would see a jump in income of nearly 500%, followed by immigration to the UAE, at almost 300%. “To step up efforts to actively recruit immigrant workers, several OECD-member countries continue to sign bilateral agreements and advance migration and mobility partnerships with selected origin countries,” the report noted, adding that Portugal, Germany, and Austria have recently concluded agreements on “migration and mobility” with India. Notably, it is the first time that Germany has signed such a bilateral agreement. The report added there was 26% more ‘permanent-type’ immigration to OECD countries in 2022 compared with the previous year, and preliminary figures for 2023 suggest a further increase. With more than 6 million new permanent immigrants, not including Ukrainian refugees, permanent immigration reached a record level in 2022, the report noted. Temporary labor migration, especially of the seasonal variety, also registered a “strong increase.” India has also emerged as the second-largest source of international students in OECD countries; 424,000 Indian students travel abroad for studies in 2021, only surpassed by China, which sent 885,000 students. According to the report, the number of students from India, Vietnam, and Nepal have more than doubled between 2014 and 2021. The report further revealed that Indians account for the largest number of international students in Canada and Latvia."

Violent flooding from glacier lakes dammed by loose rock has become more frequent as global temperatures rise and ice melts, with climate scientists warning it poses an increasing danger across the wider Himalayan mountain range. ""At least 10 people were killed and 102 others reported missing,"" Prabhakar Rai, director of the Sikkim state disaster management authority, told AFP a day after a wall of water rushed down the mountainous valley in northeastern India. Authorities said roads had been ""severely"" damaged and that 14 bridges had been washed away. Rescuers were battling to help those hit by the flood, with communications cut across large areas and roads blocked. ""Floodwaters have caused havoc in four districts of the state, sweeping away people, roads, bridges,"" Himanshu Tiwari, an Indian Army spokesman, told AFP. Twenty-two soldiers are among the missing, the army said. One previously missing soldier was rescued. The army was working to reestablish telephone connections and provide ""medical aid to tourists and locals stranded"", it said in a statement. The water surge came after intense rainfall burst the high-altitude Lhonak Lake, which sits at the base of a glacier in peaks surrounding the world's third-highest mountain, Kangchenjunga. Himalayan glaciers are melting faster than ever due to climate change, exposing communities to unpredictable and costly disasters, according to the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) research group. Water powered downstream, adding to a river already swollen by monsoon rains, damaging a dam, sweeping away houses and bridges, and causing ""serious destruction"", the Sikkim state government said. Damage was recorded more than 120 kilometres (75 miles) downstream, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised ""all possible support"" for those affected. Lhonak Lake shrunk by nearly two-thirds in size, an area roughly equivalent to about 150 football pitches (105 hectares), satellite photographs released by the Indian Space Research Organisation showed. ""Intense rain has led to this catastrophic situation in Sikkim where the rain has triggered a glacial lake outburst flood and damaged a dam, and caused loss of life,"" said Miriam Jackson, a scientist specialising in ice who monitors Himalayan regions with the Nepal-based ICIMOD. ""We observe that such extreme events increase in frequency as the climate continues to warm and takes us into unknown territory."" Earth's average surface temperature has risen nearly 1.2 degrees Celsius since pre-industrial times but high-mountain regions around the world have warmed at twice that pace, climate scientists say. Sikkim is close to India's border with Nepal and China and boasts a sizeable military presence. India has been wary of China's growing military assertiveness and their 3,500-kilometre (2,200-mile) shared frontier has been a perennial source of tension, with parts of Sikkim claimed by Beijing."

In a statement on Thursday, the country’s Ministry of Women and Child Development cited“serious methodological issues,”noting that the Global Hunger Index“continues to be a flawed measure of ‘hunger’ and does not reflect India’s true position.” The Global Hunger Index is released by NGOs Concern Worldwide and Welt Hunger Hilfe, from Ireland and Germany, respectively. It is considered a tool for comprehensively measuring and tracking hunger at the global, regional, and national levels. The new edition gave India a score of 28.7, noting that the country has a“serious”level of hunger. According to the report, undernourishment in India stands at 16.6% and the mortality rate for children below the age of five is 3.1%. It also showed that India has the highest child ‘wasting’ (the term describing low weight relative to height) rate in the world, at 18.7%, which reflects acute undernutrition. The index also claims that 58.1% of Indian women aged 15-24 suffer from anemia, a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Notably, India was ranked below neighboring countries Pakistan (102th), Bangladesh (81st), Nepal (69th), and Sri Lanka (60th). In 2022, India ranked 107th out of 121 countries surveyed – again, well below its neighbors. “Three out of the four indicators used for calculation of the index are related to the health of children,”the Health Ministrysaidin a statement, positing that it therefore,“cannot be representative of the entire population.” The government further pointed out that the fourth and“most important indicator,”the ‘proportion of undernourished (PoU) population’, is based on an opinion poll conducted on“a very small sample size of 3,000.”  “The data collected from a miniscule sample for a country of India’s size through FIES has been used to compute PoU value for India which is not only wrong and unethical, it also reeks of obvious bias,”the statement reads. The Health Ministry also claimed that the index didn’t use data collected via the government application called the Poshan Tracker, which was created as part of the drive to address malnutrition. This is despite the fact that key international organizations, including UNICEF, WHO, and the World Bank,“have acknowledged the Poshan Tracker as a game-changer in the area of nutrition,”the statement said. Based on data from the Poshan Tracker, the percentage of child ‘wasting’ in India is consistently below 7.2% month-on-month, which is in stark contrast to the 18.7% value in the Global Hunger Index 2023. The statement also pointed out that“there is hardly any evidence”that child mortality is an outcome of hunger. The Indian government allocated over 112 million metric tonnes of food grains under its food security scheme during the financial years 2020-21 and 2022-23, benefitting nearly 80 million people. It extended the scheme in January 2023, the statement added, calling it the“largest food security program in the world.” "

The area is nearly 60 kilometers (40 miles) west of Kathmandu, and the earthquake was felt in the Nepalese capital. Nepal’s National Earthquake Monitoring and Research Center gave a preliminary magnitude of 6.1. The U.S. Geological Survey provided measurements of a 5.2 magnitude with a depth of 24.7 kilometers (15.4 miles) and an epicenter near Bharatpur. Three tremors of 4.3, 4.1 and 3.8 magnitude also hit the region later Sunday, according to India’s Center for Seismology. The Press Trust of India news agency said the tremors were also felt in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces and caused panic among people. One woman suffered injuries in the Gorkha district, which adjoins Dhading, when she jumped from a two-story building, Parajuli said. Earthquakes are common in mountainous Nepal. A 7.8 magnitude earthquake in 2015 killed some 9,000 people and damaged about 1 million structures."

His hotel offers breath-taking mountain views from the town of Lumbini in Nepal - Buddha's birthplace.  But a hoped-for surge in tourist numbers has failed to materialise, blamed in part on tensions between Nepal's giant neighbours India and China. Lumbini saw close to a million visitors in 2022, according to the Lumbini Development Trust - and it was this number the government was betting on when it spent $76m (£61m) to build the Gautam Buddha International Airport, which opened in May last year.  Domestic tourists make up most of the visitors, with just less than a third travelling from neighbouring India.  The terminal, also known as Bhairahawa Airport, lets tourists fly directly to Lumbini instead of travelling 250km (155 miles) by land from the capital, Kathmandu. Yet the anticipated travel boom never materialised, something travel industry experts attribute to a lack of early promotion and incentives to international airlines.  ""The government asked us to expand tourism infrastructure saying more international flights would come. But my hotel is two-thirds empty. I am now struggling to repay my loan,"" Mr Sharma tells the BBC, adding that he is millions of rupees in debt.  Travel industry experts argue tourist arrivals, particularly from overseas, will go up if there are regular scheduled international flights operating out of Bhairahawa airport. But Nepali officials say Delhi has refused to allow big passenger planes to fly west through its airspace - meaning planes cannot fly over India to reach the Gautam Buddha airport.  Access to Indian airspace would mean shorter flights at lower cost. Some in Nepal also believe that Delhi is wary of the fact that the Gautam Buddha airport was constructed by China's Northwest Civil Aviation Airport.  The airport is also located near Nepal's border with India  - west of where the two Asian giants' troops clashed last December in the Arunachal Pradesh region, just seven months after the terminal opened to international traffic. In 2020, a major encounter between India and China killed at least 20 troops. At the centre of their dispute is an ill-defined, poorly-demarcated 3,440km (2,100-mile)-long border- called the Line of Actual Control, or LAC.  The presence of rivers, lakes and snowcaps means the line can shift. The soldiers on either side - representing two of the world's largest armies - come face to face at many points. The situation at the border is mirrored by growing political tension, with strained ties between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping. Observers say talks are the only way forward because both nuclear-armed countries have much to lose. The two countries have fought only one war, in 1962, when India suffered a humiliating defeat. The Gautum Buddha airport was meant to be the key to Nepal's plan to grow traffic by easing the load of Kathmandu - which has been for years its only international gateway. Kathmandu Airport is heavily congested and was briefly shut down by a powerful earthquake in 2015. A third international airport located in Pokhara - a town with stunning views of the Annapurna mountains and known for adventure sports - is facing a familiar problem to Bhairahawa.  Since it opened last January, the airport - built with a $215m loan from China - has not welcomed any international flights, save for a charter flight from Chengdu that brought in Chinese officials and tourists. Currently, Gautama Buddha and Pokhara have a combined traffic of 80-85 domestic flights per day. But experts say the terminals need substantial international traffic to sustain operations. ""I don't think only domestic flights will make these two airports commercially viable. It may be difficult to repay the loan without regular international flights,"" says Tri Ratna Manandhar, the former director general of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Pokhara International Airport chief Bikram Raj Gautam says Nepal needs ""proactive diplomacy"" to convince countries like India to open their airspace to commercial flights that will land in Nepal. Experts say Nepal can also look at attracting tourists from the east like Thailand, Japan and Cambodia, while Delhi's restrictions choke traffic from the west. Nepal Airlines has just started a weekly flight from Bhairahawa to Kuala Lumpur - something that should send a positive message to other airlines, Dipak Bajracharya, director of the Gautam Buddha International Airport tells the BBC. But Nepal's minister for tourism and civil aviation, Sudan Kiranti, remains optimistic that there will be a resolution with Delhi - and soon.  ""We are in constant touch and dialogue with Indian officials and diplomats,"" he tells the BBC. ""They are very positive."" With additional reporting by Surendra Phuyal in Kathmandu"

Rats have so far dug through the concrete bases of at least two flyovers, gnawed at underground sewerage and cable lines, and taken over the much of the city, from the slums and eateries of south and centralKolkatato the colonial-era buildings of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the Bidhan Sabha at Esplanade. The menace has set off alarm bells in the government, with the Trinamool Congress-run KMC scrambling for solutions — from running awareness campaigns on waste disposal to resorting to quick-fixes and reaching out to its counterparts in other states for ideas to exterminate the rats. Firhad Hakim, Trinamool leader and Kolkata Mayor, admitted toThe Indian Expressthat while they are yet to assess the extent of damage to the wires and cable lines, rats “are a major problem”. “We do not know about the population (of rats), but the effects are visible every day. Our sewerage lines, underground cables and electricity wires are getting damaged,” he told The Indian Express. KMC authorities say central Kolkata, where footpaths are lined with eateries that cater to the office crowd, and the slum areas of south Kolkata’s Dhakuria and Bhabanipore are among the worst affected. It was two years ago that the KMC was alerted to the sinking of the approach road to the Dhakuria Bridge flyover. “We reinforced the road with concrete but the problem persisted. Then we discovered these huge holes underground that rats had burrowed through and realised what was causing the subsidence,” said Mayor Hakim, blaming “illegal squatters” and “roadside eateries that throw waste food on the road” for the problem. KMC sources said rats have also damaged parts of the AJC Bose flyover in south Kolkata, digging through and loosening the soil around the foundation. With no solution in sight and no precedent to fall back on, the corporation has been reinforcing damaged structures and filling up holes on footpaths, roads and walls of bridges with a mix of concrete, sand and glass shards. “We mixed glass shards and sand grains with concrete and used that to fill up holes made by rats on the walls and pillars of flyovers. We hope this mix will restrict their movement, though we have no proof yet if it is working,” said Deputy Mayor Atin Ghosh. Ghosh said the KMC has also been conducting awareness campaigns for roadside eateries and restaurants, asking them not to throw food outside and warning them of legal action. Rat tales:Mumbaito New York From New York to Mumbai, almost every major city has been waging a battle against rat infestation. Aided by uncontrolled urbanisation, rats have outsmarted the best of city administrations, living in the darkest depths of sewerage systems and tunnels and nibbling through anything that comes their way — heaps of overflowing trash, cables, wires, even concrete. Mayor Hakim says that “sometime back”, the KMC approached the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) for help. “But they could not help us find a solution,” he said. While BMC authorities did not confirm receiving such a letter from their counterparts in Kolkata, they said their battle against rats is an ongoing one. The BMC’s insecticide department kills lakhs of rats every year as part of its monsoon drive across the city’s 24 wards. The BMC also has ‘rat labourers’, who work in shifts to hunt down rats in the city. As of July this year, 2.81 lakh rats have been killed in Mumbai. But it’s New York’s rat problem that has garnered global attention. From mandating the use of covered trash cans to establishing rat exclusion zones, and appointing a ‘Rat Czar’, Kathleen Corradi, earlier this year to tackle the city’s severe rodent crisis, New York has declared war on the rodents. In an email to The Indian Express, Noah Levine, Chief of Staff of Communications in the office of the Mayor of New York City, said one of the key steps the city took to contain rats was to replace black trash bags with lidded containers to cut down on the food source of the rodents. The rule mandates that all commercial trash — approximately 20 million pounds per day — must be in secure, lidded containers, Levine said, adding that the city’s efforts over the past 20 months have resulted in “rat sightings dropping 25 per cent this summer” compared to last year. From nibbling on toes to exposing footpath plaster Back in Kolkata, rat sightings are easy. On a weekday afternoon, a colony of rats scurry out of the ground near one of the pillars of Dhakuria Bridge, an ageing four-lane flyover in Ballygunge that has a rail line connecting Gariahut to Jadavpur running underneath. Down the flyover and on either side of the railway line are slums, shacks and eateries, with their waste finding space on the tracks and elsewhere. Sitting on the tracks of the Sealdah-Budge Budge railway line, Sonia Mondol, 25, who lives in the slums under the bridge, said, “Rats have been eating this bridge like it’s cake. Every day we see broken parts of the bridge falling off.” Two years ago, Nepal Paul, 40, shifted his tea stall from under the Dhakuria Bridge to a corner of the underpass. “The rats are a huge menace. Look at the holes in the footpath here. They are so big that two people fell down and got injured. I have had to change the plastic containers in my shop to glass,” he said. Around five km away, at the AJC Bose flyover and the nearby Nizam Palace, another of the areas that Hakim identified as rat-infested, Pintu Shaw, 28, a hawker, says, “It’s impossible to do any work here. The rats come and nibble on our toes. The PWD came here and fixed the footpath, but within a month, the holes were back,” said Shaw, pointing to the exposed plaster on the footpath and the flyover. Asim Basu, councillor of ward number 70, said, “Eateries throw leftovers, and the oil and fat from the food stick onto the walls of the underground drains. Rats eat and nibble through the concrete walls of the drain, damaging them.” The KMC headquarters and the Assembly building in the Esplanade area too have had their share of rat tales. A KMC official said, “Rats are everywhere in the KMC, but the worst-hit is the server room. The rats have chewed on the wires and machines there. They have also been damaging the control room’s electric wires regularly.” A senior IT official at the KMC said things have been a little quieter ever since the corporation installed a “RODENT” machine in the server room two months ago. “The machine generates sound waves of a very high frequency which keeps rats away,” the official said. In the Assembly building, Speaker Biman said, “I have seen rats here… with my own eyes. We are very worried. We don’t want to use poison to kill rats because the stench will be unbearable. We have spoken to the Public Works Department about this. Let’s see what can be done.” A senior official said, “Here in the Assembly, I must say rats are the only creatures that are neutral. They trouble both the ruling party as well as the Opposition. Rats have eaten food in Leader of Opposition Suvendu Adhikari’s room and they have damaged papers in the Speaker’s room.” The way out? Experts agree that while rats are everywhere, they are hard to get rid of — and even harder to count. Mukesh Thakur, head of the mammals section at the Zoological Survey of India, Kolkata, said, “It is true that there is almost no data or research on the rat population for the city of Kolkata. If KMC sends us a request, we can possibly look into it.” Shilanjan Bhattacharya, Professor of Zoology at West Bengal State University, said, “The most common rats species in the city are the Rattus norvegicus, the common brown rats with a maximum body length of 6-8 inches, and the Bandicota indica, the Indian bandicoot that can grow up to 1 foot in length and weigh nearly a kg.” “The only way the rat population can be checked is by innovating and allowing natural predators such as owls, monitor lizards and jungle cats to breed and roam in the infested area. If authorities decide that this is an emergency and absolutely necessary, the Forest Department and naturalists can work on how to manage such biological controls. No other mechanical or chemical procedures have ever been successful — especially in humid Indian cities, where garbage is abundant.” Renowned ecologist and academic Professor Madhav Gadgil offers an even more unconventional solution. Talking to The Indian Express, he said, “It may sound unorthodox, but the solution is to catch the rats, remove harmful pathogens if any and turn it into poultry feed. The solution is to bring the rats back into the food chain. In various parts of India, people eat rats, mainly field rats.”"

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage fell to an average of 7.76% in the week ending November 2, down from 7.79% the week before, according to data from Freddie Mac released Thursday. A year ago, the 30-year fixed-rate was 6.95%. The news comes a day after the Federal Reserve said in a widely anticipated move that it wouldleave its benchmark lending rate at the highest level in 22 years. “The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage paused its multi-week climb but continues to hover under 8%,” said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac’s chief economist. “The Federal Reserve again decided not to raise interest rates but has not ruled out a hike before year-end,” he said. “Coupled with geopolitical uncertainty, this ambiguity around monetary policy will likely have an impact on the overall economic landscape and may continue to stall improvements in the housing market.” Although the rate for a 30-year fixed-rate loan ticked down slightly, it remained elevated in the leadup to the two-day monetary policy meeting, which concluded Wednesday, said Hannah Jones, economic research analyst at Realtor.com. “Though the committee chose to take a pause from further contractionary policy in this week’s meeting, Chair [Jerome] Powell made the point that the committee will remain open to further policy action to bring inflation down to 2% over time, dependent on incoming data,” she said. Realtors found liable for $1.8 billion in damages in conspiracy to keep commissions high Although the Fed does not set the interest rates that borrowers pay on mortgages directly, its actions influence them. Mortgage rates tend to track the yield on 10-year US Treasuries, which move based on a combination of anticipation about the Fed actions, what the Fed actually does and investors’ reactions. When Treasury yields go up, so do mortgage rates; when they go down, mortgage rates tend to follow. On Wednesday the Treasury Department also announced that it will slow the pace of its longer-dated 10-year and 30-year bond issuance. “However, longer-term debt issuance will continue to climb, which keeps upward pressure on mortgage rates,” said Jones. With average rates over 7% since mid-August, applications for mortgages have been trending down. They declined for the third consecutive week as low inventory and high rates continued to stifle borrower demand, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Rates are expected to stay elevated until it becomes clear the Fed is done hiking rates, according to MBA. How the Fed is using its multi-trillion-dollar balance sheet to fight inflation “We were pleased to see that the Fed held short-term rates steady yesterday and continue to believe that it should not hike again and not sell its holdings of mortgage-backed securities until and unless the housing finance market has stabilized,” said Bob Broeksmit, MBA president and CEO. “These actions would help to lower mortgage rates and improve homebuyer affordability heading into 2024.” Mortgage rates should stay stable in the next few months, said Jones, since another two-day monetary policy meeting is not scheduled until December. That should give homebuyers a small bit of comfort, she says. “Today’s buyers face scarce for-sale inventory, still-high listing prices, and multi-decade high mortgage rates, so any potential relief from climbing housing costs is welcomed,” Jones said."

The daughter of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina is one of two candidates for the SEARO position. Saima Wazed's nomination has sparked controversy with many health experts calling it ""nepotism,"" and expressing concern over the election process to fill senior roles at the U.N. health body. A candidate for the SEARO post should have a ""strong technical and public health background and extensive experience in global health"", according to the WHO website. The candidate should also have ""competency in organizational management"" and ""proven historical evidence for public health leadership"", the website says. The next SEARO chief will be elected through a secret ballot by the region's 11 member countries, which include Bangladesh, Nepal and India. The vote is scheduled to take place in New Delhi during a WHO regional committee meeting Oct. 30-Nov. 2. Countries in the region nominate candidates to head the WHO regional office. Wazed was nominated by the government of Bangladesh. In addition to Wazed, who is a mental health advocate, only one other candidate has been put forward: Shambhu Acharya, a public health expert and senior WHO official who was nominated by Nepal. Questions have been raised about the disparity between the candidates' qualifications.Wazed has a master's degree in clinical psychology from Barry University, a school in Florida. She has spent nearly a decade serving as an adviser to the director general of the WHO on mental health and autism issues. Acharya has been with the WHO for almost 30 years. He has experience working with the U.N. body in senior positions and holds a Ph.D. in public health, health policy and financing from the University of North Carolina. Sixteen public health experts in Nepal issued a statement saying that Acharya ""is the better fit"" of the two candidates vying for the SEARO director's position. ""[Acharya] possesses a very strong public health background and has extensive leadership experience in tackling global health issues,"" the statement said. ""He knows the public health and medical challenges of our region intimately, having worked for three decades to strengthen responses at local, national, regional and global levels, including in Nepal, Bangladesh and India, apart from his responsibilities at [the] WHO headquarters in Geneva."" So far there have not been any public statements of support for Wazed from public health experts in Bangladesh. Right now a strong anti-Hasina wave is sweeping Bangladesh, ahead of next general election all likely to be held in January. With the US closely monitoring the forthcoming election in Bangladesh many believe the ruling Awami League party will not be able to rig the elections this time and lose power. In such a situation many, long-known as pro-Awami League groups, are not speaking in support of Hasina, her party and family members now. However, AK Abdul Momen, Bangladesh's foreign minister spoke in support of Wazed's candidacy several days ago. In an interview with the Indian newspaper The Hindu, the minister demanded that Nepal withdraw its candidate from the contest for the WHO-SEARO post. ""[Nepal's candidate] had been working in the WHO for the last 30 years and was in a decision-making position. So why have [health indices] not improved in the whole of the South East Asian region, even though he himself is a person of South Asian origin?"" Momen asked while adding that Acharya should ""step down"" from the race for the WHO-SEARO post. Wazed, who has held advisory positions at some Bangladesh government mental health bodies, rebuffed accusations that her nomination was ""fueled by nepotism"" because her mother is the prime minister. She said those critical of her nomination were overlooking her experience and achievements in the field of mental health. ""They ignore that I have been an adviser to WHO's DG on Mental Health & Autism, or that I have been a member of the WHO's Expert Advisory Panel on mental health for almost a decade,"" Wazed wrote in an Inter Press Service opinion piece earlier this month. ""They do not mention that I am [the] chief adviser to Bangladesh's National Mental Health Strategic Plan, or that I was a technical expert for Bangladesh's National Mental Health Act of 2018,"" she wrote. Bangladesh's nomination of Wazed has also come under scrutiny by several activists and public health experts. Bishow Parajuli, former U.N. resident coordinator and U.N. Development Program representative in Myanmar and Zimbabwe, said that Wazed has limited experience and qualifications to assume such a leadership position. ""In a country with so many qualified and competent health professionals, the nomination of Ms. Wazed, and her use of the Prime Ministerial Office to engage with the various world leaders, also shows nepotism and the influence of her mother's office in the process. …The selection must be made 'on the basis of merits,'"" he said in emailed comments. Paris-based Bangladeshi social activist and physician Pinaki Bhattacharya said Wazed has none of the required qualifications for the WHO-SEARO post. ""Hasina and her daughter are not aware that while being a descendant of the powerful can give one political advantage, the position of a professional international health leader requires the necessary education, skills and talent,"" he told VOA. In recent weeks, Wazed accompanied her mother, Sheikh Hasina, on a high-profile diplomatic tour attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York and the summit in New Delhi of the 20 biggest economies, known as the G20. Wazed accompanied Prime Minister Hasina during her meetings with U.S. President Joe Biden, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Wazed said she is used to being held to different professional standards than men, and having her identity reduced to simply being ""her mother's daughter,"" which is blatant sexism, Wazed said. Wazed has not responded to a VOA email requesting direct comment on the nepotism issue. Kent Buse is director of the Global Healthier Societies Program at The George Institute for Global Health at Imperial College London. Buse told VOA that the rules governing the selection of directors across all WHO regions need considerable reform to ensure public confidence in the merit-based nature of the organization. ""This relates to improving transparency and delivering enhanced oversight of the election process. This should include better scrutiny of the candidate's compliance with the existing codes of conduct governing the campaign processes.""  "
